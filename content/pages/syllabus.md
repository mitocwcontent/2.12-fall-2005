Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Labs: 1 session / week, 2 hours / session

Prerequisites
-------------

[2.004](/courses/2-004-modeling-dynamics-and-control-ii-spring-2003) and [2.003](/courses/2-003-modeling-dynamics-and-control-i-spring-2005).

This course is a restricted elective (professional subject).

Course Text
-----------

Asada, H., and J. J. Slotine. _Robot Analysis and Control_. New York, NY: Wiley, 1986. ISBN: 9780471830290.

This book will be supplemented by newly written [lecture notes]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/lecture-notes), which are a preliminary version of the book's second edition. While the book was originally written for graduate-level courses, the new lecture notes are primarily for undergraduate juniors and seniors, assuming 2.003 and 2.004 level background knowledge about dynamics and control.

Labs and Projects
-----------------

Lab sessions are geared toward completion of two projects - a de-mining robot and a robot that finds and rescues disaster victims.
